This is MATLAB code for an Agent Based Model used to simulate an infection. Start with Process.m

We take GPS location data for u users over t times. Each user may or may not be infected and spreads the infection as a (probabilistic) function of how close they are to someone else.

From the testing data, we partition the area covered by all users (essentially the Purdue campus) into k clusters. Then, for each cluster, we determine how likely someone is to move to another cluster (modeling movement) and interact within a cluster (modeling behavior).

Using this information, we simulate an infection and compare the number of people infected at any time to the observed training data.

The parameter optimized is simply the number of clusters, as all other variables are a function of the number of clusters.
